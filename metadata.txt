about=This Plugin used to find the least-cost path between to location on DEM Surface using anisotropic accumulated-cost surface and A* algorithm. Anisotropic accumulated - cost surface algorithm used in this plugin reference to the algorithm described by Yu C., Lee J., and Munro-Stasiuk M J (2003) base on their journal (Yu C., Lee J., and Munro-Stasiuk M J., 2003, “Extensions to Least-Cost Path Algorithms For Roadway Planning”, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, Vol. 17, No. 4, hal. 361–376.). A* algorithm used in this plugin reference to Lester (2005) written on website ( www.policyalmanac.org/games/aStar.html)
